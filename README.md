Casa C2200 C3200 Cable Modem USSNR 


Short PHP Script that polls the CMTS for current USSNR conditions at the Cable Modem Level. 

Utilizes the Cable Modem IP to do a lookup against the CMTS for Mac Address. 


Can be useful when mixed with a script to constantly refresh when looking for variances in upstream signal to noise at the cable modem

Could probably be done in less than 20 lines, but broken up incase it needs to be revisited at later date
